main.js --> EditorApp --> Page

main.js creates the EditorApp.
The EditorApp lasts for the duration of the HTML page, until a non-hashfrag nav, refresh, close, etc.
EditorApp pays attention to the URL hash, and loads and unloads Pages.

Pages have load and unload, where they add and remove HTML, and can do other things.
Some Pages are boring old DOM, like a file tree browser.
Other Pages create a full-screen canvas element, and then delegate most logic to a Screen,
which takes the canvas and handles WebGL, RequestAnimationFrame, on-canvas control widgets, etc.

AdventureListPage is the top level "Page" based on hash-frag nav.
It lists all the adventures, and has UI for creating more, deleting, exporting, etc.

Within an Adventure:
* LevelListPage is for managing levels that constitute a single adventure
* ExportPage is for exporting a single adventure's worth of JSON

For a single level:
* LevelEditorPage is for editing
  * Creates HTML and kicks off shader loading, and then creates the Screen, below.
  * EditScreen handles a single large canvas + a menu popup element
  * Auto-saves when this virtual Page is unloaded for any reason, including closing the tab.
* LevelTestPage is for play-testing
  * Creates HTML and kicks off shader loading, and then creates the Screen, below.
  * TestScreen handles a single large canvas + a menu popup element
