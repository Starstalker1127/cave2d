Background:
I liked making a game (Vorp) but it took forever, and the editor isn't that good,
and the game isn't really super great, though it has great elements.
Also, it doesn't work on touchscreens.
But I'm still obsessed with game ideas. My fantasy is to make a new one every
week.

Goals:
Write a library that combines performance with developer productivity.
Create tools that simplify level and robot making to the point where
a 1st-grader should be able to make & share stuff.

Tech elements:
v JS
x Very loose coupling?
v Web Audio
v Multiple renderers
v Touch and mouse support
- Event-driven, using predicted inter-frame delays to do expected work and prep a graphics frame.
- Quad-tree wall/space support
- Focus on letting people (me) make new games, not new levels in existing game?
- Robots.
v WebGL!

Inspiration:
Adventure (2600)
Dandy
Gauntlet (the obscure fixed-screen space/cave flying/shooting game, not "wizard shot the food")
Pac Man
Wizard of Wor
Dig Dug
Boulder Dash
Robotron & Llamatron
N the ninja game
Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set
Moon Patrol

Basic gameplay for Game 1:
Run around a 2d cave, avoiding or shooting robots.

Game ideas

Time warp ideas:
You have shields, but when they're down to zero, time slows down, which makes you super accurate and faster than
the enemies and traps.

Skip: short-range teleport

Two-endpoint portals can be carried by two players with tractor beams.
Or one player with a weapon can send things through a portal to assist a second player.
Two-thumb trator beam: Release button to drop. Flick and release to throw. Magnitude of movement creates temporary
charge, which fades, and gets consumed as activation for tools, and builds kick for throwing.

Control ideas

Tap the fire button to fire in the direction of travel, but drag to activate aimable special, like tractor, mace,
or aiming fire/ice/earth. Mostly I like tractor though, because you need to interact with the rest of the world more.
Might only work with touch and mouse. Hard to do stuff like that on a trackpad, I think.

I think the one-button tractor-beam is going to be the easiest, most intuitive, most portable thing, if I can get the
forces right.

Tactile, uniform level+menu system.

Every screen is a pointer-sensitive level.
Know how to map between screen and world coords all the time, with matrix and inverse matrix.
A world is still effectively 2D, so letters become world objects.
Multiple worlds coexist onscreen, with their own coord systems.
This can help with an editor, and with button controls. I like the merger of title and level.
And there's no reason the controls for title and play aren't the same.
The Title can be level 0.
The "Settings" shortcut is always a door to a spirit-world, or a mini-game.

To stretch short sounds, use a delay node per sound, and change the amount of delay over time.
A delay node can have a value from 0 to 3 minutes (180), so a one-second sound can be stretched 180x
For more continuous sounds, decrease oscillator frequencies, since there's not enough delay runway.

Use suspend and resume when pausing? Or just drop the level's gain to 0 and stop animating, letting
the existing sounds peter out.
