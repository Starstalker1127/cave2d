Background:
I liked making a game (Vorp) but it took forever, and the editor isn't that good,
and the game isn't really super great, though it has great elements.
Also, it doesn't work on touchscreens.
But I'm still obsessed with game ideas. My fantasy is to make a new one every
week.

Goals:
Write a library that combines performance with developer productivity.
Create tools that simplify level and robot making to the point where
a 1st-grader should be able to make & share stuff.

Tech elements:
JS
Very loose coupling
Web Audio
Multiple renderer
Touch and mouse support
Event-driven, using predicted inter-frame delays to do expected work and prep a graphics frame.
Quad-tree wall/space support
Focus on letting people (me) make new games, not new levels in existing game.
Robots.

Inspiration:
Adventure (2600)
Dandy
Gauntlet (the obscure fixed-screen space/cave flying/shooting game, not "wizard shot the food")
Pac Man
Wizard of Wor
Dig Dug
Boulder Dash
Robotron
N the ninja game

Basic gameplay for Game 1:
Run around a 2d cave, avoiding or shooting robots.

Fancy gameplay:
Flexible gameclock time. Maybe even slow down sound effects.
Musical-ish.
Faces on things.

Big idea - sprite behavior affected by being line-of-sight to certain artifacts.
- love or fear artifact
- artifact induces aggression or passivity
- artifact can be carried, gives owner power, but is cursed - like LOTR's R.
Examples:
- artifact causes creatures to hang out near it and attack other creatures
- artifact causes fear - nobody can get close to it
- artifact induces blindness or short vision
- or invisibility
- or invulnerabinity
- or slows/speeds - affects clock cycle frequency. Player's sense of time is altered if affected.
- turns sprites to stone
- makes sprites invulnerable but very slow
