Background:
I liked making a game (Vorp) but it took forever, and the editor isn't that good,
and the game isn't really super great, though it has great elements.
Also, it doesn't work on touchscreens.
But I'm still obsessed with game ideas. My fantasy is to make a new one every
week.

Goals:
Write a library that combines performance with developer productivity.
Create tools that simplify level and robot making to the point where
a 1st-grader should be able to make & share stuff.

Tech elements:
v JS
x Very loose coupling?
v Web Audio
v Multiple renderers
v Touch and mouse support
- Event-driven, using predicted inter-frame delays to do expected work and prep a graphics frame.
- Quad-tree wall/space support
- Focus on letting people (me) make new games, not new levels in existing game?
- Robots.
v WebGL!

Inspiration:
Adventure (2600)
Dandy
Gauntlet (the obscure fixed-screen space/cave flying/shooting game, not "wizard shot the food")
Pac Man
Wizard of Wor
Dig Dug
Boulder Dash
Robotron & Llamatron
N the ninja game
Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set
Moon Patrol

Basic gameplay for Game 1:
Run around a 2d cave, avoiding or shooting robots.

Game ideas

Time warp ideas:
You have shields, but when they're down to zero, time slows down, which makes you super accurate and faster than
the enemies and traps.

Skip: short-range teleport

Two-endpoint portals can be carried by two players with tractor beams.
Or one player with a weapon can send things through a portal to assist a second player.
Two-thumb tractor beam: Release button to drop. Flick and release to throw. Magnitude of movement creates temporary
charge, which fades, and gets consumed as activation for tools, and builds kick for throwing.

Control ideas

Tap the fire button to fire in the direction of travel, but drag to activate aimable special, like tractor, mace,
or aiming fire/ice/earth. Mostly I like tractor though, because you need to interact with the rest of the world more.
Might only work with touch and mouse. Hard to do stuff like that on a trackpad, I think.

I think the one-button tractor-beam is going to be the easiest, most intuitive, most portable thing, if I can get the
forces right.

To stretch short sounds, use a delay node per sound, and change the amount of delay over time.
A delay node can have a value from 0 to 3 minutes (180), so a one-second sound can be stretched 180x
For more continuous sounds, decrease oscillator frequencies, since there's not enough delay runway.

Use suspend and resume when pausing? Or just drop the level's gain to 0 and stop animating, letting
the existing sounds peter out.

Your moves are based on a short beat-song. Remix the song (or certain tracks) before each level to determine your
sequence of motions/actions for that level.
Maybe there's tension between the musicality of it and the gameplay needs?
Unlock new samples/instruments as you go.

An action game is made of moves to master. Trackball control affords some good ones.
* Excellent strafing w aim-lock
* Precision aiming during aim-lock.
* Precist fast evasion.
* Very fast flings with some precision.

Counter-blast:
Enemy is shielded, and only drops shields during slightly foreshadowed laser-blast attack.
Tactic: Aim off-angle, prepare R-Type-style blast, wait for enemy to fire. When enemy's shields are lowered,
combine side-dodge and counter-attack.

Dodging:
Enemy fires left/right parallel sweep. Player has to weave in the middle.
Very fast sweep-beam attack. Player needs to orbit carefully or take cover.

Full speed:
Unblockable blast or swift pursuers. Player needs to flee at top-speed.


I would really love to do a tractor-beam game where you can use tools.
Left touch to move.
If left is touching,
- right touch to grab in direction of trackball
- else right touch to what? shield?
Once grabbed:
- lift both touched to release
- lift right touch to let it rotate freely
- right touch locks it in position, and right drag and pushes it, though it wants to return to default dist from plr.
- Some things respond to tractor-lock, onEnter or onExit. Sometimes they need to warm up though.
- Some things are triggered by onGrab or onRelease too.

Simpler:
- Right touch is grab (and lock angle), release is release.
- Quick beam-button down/up does a kick. Hold-and-release is gentler. longhold, then up/down/up is bigger kick?
- Some things are activated by being grabbed, staying grabbed, or being released. Or being bumped hard.
This seems easy and flexible.
- Wield and throw spike-balls, bumpers.
- Lightsaber?
- Catch things.
- Rotate and position objects, like turrets, beamers, shovers, catchers, thrusters, smokers, scanners, scopes,
  chow-ploppers, blippers, beamcaster, broadcaster, extractor...
- Powerful items can be chained down.
- Arrange things, build things, pull them apart. Combines mouse and physics-limits. YES.
- Lure creatures with their favorite food.
- Scoop up lots of stuff using a chain carried by two players.
- Clog vacuum-hoses (like grip-switches)
- Feed monsters (who can't bite while chewing)
- Grab onto things

Direct beams to parts. Acquire more parts. Build a thing to do what?
"defeat monster" or "reach position" are OK. "survive for time T" and "collect N objects. What are other goals?


MAKE WORLDS AND PLAY IN THEM, AS ONE UNIFIED EXPERIENCE

Childhood play involves alternating between world-creator and world-participant.
Constant role-switching and what-if-ing.

Minecraft makes changing the world central, but it's limited to the player's
powers. It's tedious to make huge changes.

Vorp had fast switching, but "play" means starting the level from the beginning.
And the editor was powerful but hard to use.

I'd like to make a system that supports childhood play style. Changing
between editing and playing is a shift in UI emphasis, not a major state change.

The plan is to keep the world simple, and build the system. First, the proof of concept.
* pause/resume.
* World speed control?
* mutually exclusive touch-modes:
  * create wall
  * create tunnel
  * manipulate objects
  * auto mode - starting touch target decides wall/tunnel/object choice for this gesture (maybe *only* this?)
  * Control a playable character. No one character is always "you". Be anybody, change abilities & locations.
  * Pan & zoom mode? Camera follows player? Camera is an in-world object that you can drag?

Ideas for later:
* Tap a complex object to zoom in, tap outside to zoom back out.
* Split screen
