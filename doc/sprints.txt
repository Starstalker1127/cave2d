WEAPONS & ENEMIES
* enemies can be grabbed and used as weapons
* But they must be basically dead for it to work?

* Giant enemies cannot be carried or used? Or they can be but they're so darn heavy that it sucks to try and
  they don't fit in narrow spaces.

- Glaive! Activated, it zooms away, comes back, but is easy-ish to catch again. But it can kill you...

Better deaths/explosions
- two-part models with spiky bits
* Splashy everything like I have today
* Physics-y everything like N++. Nice if you can afford it! Mostly only hits walls
* shader tricks
  * fat fragment shader, simply geometry (circle?)
  * fancy vertex shader with numbered objects and parameterized explosions
