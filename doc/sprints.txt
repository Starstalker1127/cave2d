Game logic for mutable, explorable, yet limited terrain, v1.
All bodies will always be in memory, and all models will be in GL, but we'll only draw visible models.
v Load all dirty wall cells after level creation, and all adjacent uniform wall cells, so we get no gaps adjacent to
  dirty cells.
  v get x,y from cellId
v push-scroll camera - drag it so focal object (player body for now) is never more than X world dist away from camera.
v Draw each cell separately
  v Have separate GL models for every non-uniform cell.
    v cell def
      v BitGrid cellId
      v body id array (or null if bodies weren't loaded)
      v private GL model handle, or null if none
  x Use one model for uniform cells.
  x Draw solid cells that have no bodies? Or draw floor cells only? Kinda digging the floor idea.
v Draw every cell on the screen, and a little more for shader-distortion padding, but no more.
v mutation: unload and reload any loaded cells that change, and doublecheck adjacent cells.
  v Make bullets destroy terrain, to test mutation

Fix WorldEvent memory leak? Is it infinite-duration paths clogging up the event queue?
Nope. The problems were:
1) Tiny world cells probably sucked
2) Double-adding bodies when terrain changed was certainly bad.
3) Walls were declared to collide with themselves, which was wrong.
4) The event queue had events with times of Infinity. Good luck with that.
