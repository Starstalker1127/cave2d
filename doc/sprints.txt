Trail Drawing
Separates sprite drawing from rendering timing.
Rendering commands should be temporal, describing how to draw something that happened
in the past. API ideas:
addLine(x0, y0, t0, x1, y1, t1, pixelDuration)
Other params: color, size
Do it in 2d <canvas> first.
- collection of un-garbage-collected lines
- addLine(x0, y0, t0, x1, y1, t1, duration)
- setTime(t)
- setTimeFloor(t) // anything that falls entirely below that can be deleted
- drawTo(canvas)

Animation Lib
- event pump w RequestAnimationFrame polyfill (it's prefixed in a couple browsers)
- animation period measurement with Date.now() polyfill
- change crossover to use trail drawing and animation
