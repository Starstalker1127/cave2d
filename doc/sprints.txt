Drop & Throw
v add kick+move = throw (implement as insta-kick)
v keep kick+stillness = drop

Make enemy development easier with some library biz.
- Wake and Sleep: hooks around timeouts, distance limits, friction, nearly-drawn, low-power, bump-wake, other wake
  v document Ant spirit efficiency biz
  - make it re-usable for spirit
    - plan it!
    - pull it up
- factor out Ant and Centipede Wall avoidance
  - search for wall ahead
  - side-sweep to find clear path, early bail
- target-intercept behavior, like tractor beam
  - search for target
    - random search (or structured sweep?)
    - compare candidate target with current target if any.
  - target chosen
    - scan towards target
    - move to intercept
      - choose along vector of where target is (0) and where intercept point is (1)
        - pull out intercept code for Avoidance
      - adjust vel to target vel or whatever
- target-avoidance
  - same as intercept, but adjust vel away from target vel
- Also do diff between "hit target hard" and "come to rest at dist D from target", mjolnir-style
- stun effect (timer mostly)
- flying/knock-back that sends lower traction to 0 for a time (until it hits something?). Often combined with stun.
- ice effect - shiny crystal
- slime effect - smooth lumps
- damage flashs for non-fatal damage

- make a bullet that does the same

Awesome weapons and effects:
- Mjolnir
  - auto-hits enemies when swung around, with heavy knockback
  - When activated, charges up,
    and when released, flies and seeks one enemy, then returns (gently) to player for grabbing
  - When dropped, is immovable?
- Waymaker
  - Smashes anything, digs a tunnel
- Gale
  - medium-length wind force repels all enemies (and objects)
- Wide-area stun




Most super-basic:
* gun-acting robot enemy that is also a weapon
* more of that



So:
- basic shooter
- slimer
- shotgunner
- machine-gun
- grenade
- snowball
- rogue
- flame-thrower
- rocket
- laser burst
- seeker missile
- sustained laser


Proper weapons, mostly melee or thrown
- mace
- star(s)
- glaive

Plants with interesting qualities.
- bomb
- mine
- slime
- gas
- frost
- bramble?
- decoy

Robots with more powerful weapons, that you can grab and use!

Monsters

Breath weapons
- Gas and spark monster makes an easy weapon.
- Slime barfer
- ice breath
- flame breath
- water spitter
Robots
* turrets of course
* walkers
* sometimes explode!
- shielders
- repulsors
- blasters (primitive)
- rail-gun
- missiles
- repair drones
Plants (grenades)
- bomb fruit
- gas fruit
- slime fruit
- bramble fruit?
Pure tools
- lance
- drill
- glaive
- mine
- grenade

Different movement characteristics
- forward speed
- sidestep speed
- backward speed
- turning speed


melee

throw
gas - hazard only for now, flamable later. Gas immunity
slime - makes it easy to direct enemies into gas
fire
ice


- Glaive! Activated, it zooms away, comes back, but is easy-ish to catch again. But it can kill you...

- Basic shooter
  - wanders, fires slow bullet occasionally at player
- shotgunner
- machine gunner
- bomb thrower (also bombs can be caught and thrown!)
- sniper

- contact mines
  - may be grabbed and kicked safely
  - touching makes them boom, physical shrapnel

behaviors:
- go forward
- scan to avoid walls
- hug wall
- wall skating?
- scan for player(s)
- fire a weapon at a target

- stationary turret
  - scan for players
  - fire at them

- patrolling turret
  - slowly move, avoiding walls

- The Living Statue
  - Frozen and spike-shielded when player is in view
  -

- sleepy chaser
  - sleep when far from players
  - scan towards player when plr is close enough, to maybe wake up
    - ordered scan, closest player first
  - wake on contact or when player is visible
  - chase to where player was last visible
  - last-seen timer
  - new good wall avoiding biz too

- fast tunnel racer! finally.
  - scans towards players
  - if plr seen, fire at player and run away
  - hard to hit/kill

- juggernaut
  - slow wanderer
  - when player seen, shields and charges at player, until contact with infinite mass or max time.


- shotgun

v rapid-fire
  - change to laser?
- centipede

- wall-hugger missile
- tunnel lurker

- rail gun (penetrates, accurate, laser scope)
- summoner
- turret

- grenade launcher (explosive area of effect)
- sniper

- rocket launcher

- ice beam

- slime splasher, lowers traction a lot


Better deaths/explosions
- two-part models with spiky bits
* Splashy everything like I have today
* Physics-y everything like N++. Nice if you can afford it! Mostly only hits walls
* shader tricks
  * fat fragment shader, simply geometry (circle?)
  * fancy vertex shader with numbered objects and parameterized explosions
