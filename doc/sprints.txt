Game logic for mutable, explorable, yet limited terrain, v1.
All bodies will always be in memory, and all models will be in GL, but we'll only draw visible models.
v Load all dirty wall cells after level creation, and all adjacent uniform wall cells, so we get no gaps adjacent to
  dirty cells.
  v get x,y from cellId
v push-scroll camera - drag it so focal object (player body for now) is never more than X world dist away from camera.
- Draw each cell separately
  - Have separate GL models for every non-uniform cell.
  - Use one model for uniorm cells.
  - Draw solid cells that have no bodies? Or draw floor cells only? Kinda digging the floor idea.
- Draw every cell on the screen, and a little more for shader-distortion padding, but no more.
- mutation: unload and reload any loaded cells that change, and doublecheck adjacent cells.
  - Make bullets destroy terrain, to test mutation
