game4 nest
v take over old game4

reduce setScreenListening redundancy
v shrink testscreen's setScreenListening()
v ditto for playscreen
v repeat for all the play/test code that could use it throughout cave2d

2017-06-24

v testScreen inherits from playScreen, to de-dupe a lot of code.

game4 multiplayer controls

v create the 7 slots
  v study test45
  v page calls configurePlayerSlots() near initializing the world
  v screen.configurePlayerSlots()

Refactoring
v pull renderer up out of test44-45 and game4 and replace the main renderer
v standardize metrics, graphing code chunks
  v initStatMons
  v fields
    v statMons
      v leftStatMons

Game4 Basic Mechanics
v entrance 1
  v entrance spirit
    v config
    v editor-able
    v remove player from editor menu
  v zero players
    v camera at entrance
  v add player at entrance
  v respawn after death
    v death by critter
v exit 1: basic game2 biz
v useful objects & activation
  * based on "Vehicles" basic neuron model
  * Each target has one input port that accepts any number of simultaneous connections.
  * Input values are steady values that change discontinuously, in sudden steps.
  v data structures
    v Source maintains map from target spirit IDs to output values to those targets, in case source gets polled.
    v Target maintains set of source spirit IDs, for polling.
    v Target also maintains map from pulse input end time to pulse input value.
  v activation by linked spirit
    v api
      v targetSpirit.addInputSource(sourceSpiritId) // set output value first in case target reads it
      v targetSpirit.removeInputSource(sourceSpiritId)
      v targetSpirit.onInputChanged(sourceSpiritId, val)
      v sourceSpirit.getOutputToTarget(targetId)
      x world.isOutputInputPair(sourceId, targetId) // debugging only?
  v activation by pulse or ray
    v targetSpirit.addInputPulse(duration)
  v target polls inputs on events and timeouts (anything that could change values)
    v targetSpirit.sumOfInputs()
    v iterate through pulses, culling obsolete ones and adding valued from active ones
    v iterate through sources, culling or adding
  v exercise the system
    v player activates indicator light
      v indicator light spirit that just shows whether there's any input or not
        v basic spirit
        v add to editor menu
        v polls for activation during rendering
      v player tractor beam can activate target
        v wield adds source
        v unwield detaches it
        v activate sets val to 1
        v deactivate 0
      v whole thing works
    v player wielding/activating/ejecting twists things to point along wield vector
    v activator raygun that serves 2 purposes:
      v it is activation target, like the light
      v When activated, it fires activation bullets that can activate stuff like lights and other rayguns
        v activation bullet spirit
          v collision triggers activation pulse

Movement again...
v traction or responsive movement
v good slow aim precision

Bugs and cleaning
v Unlock mouse pointer when paused, relock on resume
v Activator gun fire schedule
  v use new timeout (don't re-use friction)
  v don't stop firing when off-screen
v higher friction/traction on all manipulable objects

x change Wield physics? (what did I have in mind??)

    v Populate slotNames when creating slots.
    v method for adding a player by slotName
  v Slots
    * need permanent serializable IDs
    v replace random slot.id with real names
  v Maintain pointerlock across levels

v Increase "slot" responsibility
  v player spirit in slot
  v remove list of player spirits from playScreen
    v use slots instead
  v remove slot from playerSpirit
    v pass controlList to playerSpirit.handleInput
    v remove slot state checking from player
  v player circle (from spirit)
    v slot calls follow each frame
  v player camera (from spirit)
  v remove lastSpiritId
  v death
    v when player spirit dies, find its slot (scan?) to update state
    v know player death time
    v remember death position
    v nuke player spirit immediately because slot knows all
  v know respawn world position
  v respawn
    v do it on first frame after death time is up. No timeout.
    v and only if player is still playing
    v free: prevents player from dropping and respawning super fast

v death 2
  v fragment-view circle shrinks to nothing in-place
    * don't encourage dying to get extra info
    * slow enough to see how you died, fast enough to not be totally annoying.
  v ghost returns to spawn point
    x player gets ghost body? Maybe totally invisible non-body would be fine.
    x ghost pan/zoom camera circle doesn't affect shader during normal draw.
    x ghosts are drawn always - separate pass with different shader params so they don't get clipped out
    x touching spawn point restores solid player body, back to normal.

v exit 2
  * all players must be present and relaxed to exit
  v exit has circle body
    v new test level
  v 1/distfrac shader
    v add shader fork
      v borrow from test32
    v make existing weird shader near exit work first
    v draw exit as every player but using the weird shader
    v then try 1/distfrac shader
    v make players visible in exit mirror even when very far away
  x cache exit warp arrays
  x allow multiple exits to draw mirror
  ... OK, the 1/dist shader is cool but the idea for the exit was a bust.
  v start exit when all players are close
    v exit tracks player distances
  v arrow & star
    v models
      b arrow - tip is 0,0
      v star - center is 0,0
    v for each player
      v if too far, draw arrow between player and exit
        v scale and position based on dist:
          v small and far if far
          v big and close to exit when plr is close
          v smaller as plr gets really close
      v if close enough, draw star over player's head
        v grow with proximity to exit
        v pull player into exit orbit?


v Bug! I need to disable screen-lock in edit mode.
  Something about transition from test to edit?
v Bug in undo/redo for exit/entrance spirits.

v eliminate wall T-junctions and make edges meshy
  v start new BitRect to hold data and logic for bit rect conversions
    v without breaking everything
      v update every bitgrid user
      v createWorldRect() to do what BitGrid did
    v refactor BitGrid to use BitRect's createWorldRect
      v pull bitrect creation out into something the fan method can use later
  v fan basics
    v for now, just an array of Vec4
    v BitGrid can return a pile of fans
    v TileGrid can create models and stamps from said pile. Triangles for now since I don't really use GL fans.
      v Model.createFanFromVec4Array(list of v4s)
      v sanity-test by randomizing vertex colors?
  v optimize
    v detailed
      v don't add vertex at top/bottom if the opposite cell pair is solid+solid
        v but do add 'em every so often... every 4?
    x solid
      x create 16 different solid tile models, for each "is-neighbor-detailed" value, 2^4
      x live draw the right one based on the 4 neighbors - don't even bother caching?

v fix long midpoint-to-corner triangle edges by breaking up rects
  v chop fan rects every 8 bits! Then midpoints and chunks will be every 4, nice and even.
    v or every 4!

v Fix fragment shader interaction with distortion. Pass new x/y in, not original x/y.

v Add fragment shader wall rendering texture biz and make sure it distorts well


SIMPLER CONTROLS
Always wield
v remove drag. Go straight to wield.
v remove eject. Go straight to drop.
v restore speed while wielding.

EXPLOSION THOUGHTS
* Splashy everything like I have today
* Physics-y everything like N++. Nice if you can afford it! Mostly only hits walls
* Blend physics-y shrapnel and splashy clouds?
* shader tricks
  * fat fragment shader, simply geometry (circle?)
  * fancy vertex shader with numbered objects and parameterized explosions

How about explosions that
AWESOME EXPLOSIONS IN JUST A FEW GL CALLS
ALSO AWESOME POLYLINE DRAWING USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE
- Long list of models, all pretty much the same  tiny thing, maybe tetrahedrons? but that's not important now.
- Each vertex has a model number, a float from 0 to 1, to make this easy to scale to different counts.
- Vertex shaders reposition and recolor each model independently based on an array of params, and time.
- params are things like... The transformation for position 0
-

WEAPONS & ENEMIES
- shotgun
- swarm

v rapid-fire
  - change to laser?
