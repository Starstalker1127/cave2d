#### MILESTONE: Nice editable mazes, for mouse and touch
#### COMPLETE
What I learned:
* Quadtrees are cute but kind of a pain in the A too because they're not a simple grid.
* The system of void/wall/floor drawing is good. Keep it.
* Multi-gesture+mouse drawing-based map editing is really great, and I want to keep that.
* Turns out the Vorp code isn't as easy to reuse and adapt as I'd hoped.

Now it's time to rewrite the physics & gameplay engine, to be easier to understand and use.

Body
* Used by the internal collider to enqueue future events.
* Used by the internal default collision response code.
* Used by Sprites, through a careful API which handles pathId invalidation.
v Identity
  v id
  v spiritId or 0
v Path
  v pathId - changes whenever a trajectory field changes. 0 means it's invalid.
  v pathStartTime - just for calculating position as func of time
  v pathStartPos
  v vel
  v pathEndTime - for not looking ahead too far, if acceleration is scheduled.
v Shape (affects path)
  v shapeType (circle or rect)
  v rad (for circles)
  v radX (for rects)
  v radY (for rects)
v hitGroup (changing invalidates path. Probably changes infrequently.)
v mass
v elasticity
v getPosAtTime(t, out)
v getBoundingRect(t, out)
v set pos & vel
v alloc & free
I'm trying to be uncompromising: Don't create an object field pointing to a parent. Pass the parent in to methods.

Spirit baseclass
A spirit subclass can have lots of custom logic, scheduling, sensing, body-manipulation, etc.
v id
v world event handlers: start, timeout, hit
x bodyIds? Or just methods that take lists of bodies, and single bodies?

World (but not all its collider aspects)
v spirits {id: spirit}
v bodies {id: body}
v pathIdToBody {id: body}
v world's spirit-facing API:
  v addBody
  v removeBody
  v getBody
  x setTimeout
  x cancelTimeout
  (later: rayscans)
v getBodyByPathId purges obsolete pathId keys

How will path invalidations get buffered up for when the World needs to move time forward?
Easy way is to make each Body hold World, like a parent pointer. I tried to avoid it but maybe I can't.
It's cleaner to include the PathInvalidator in each Body, and the World, like Vorp does. Sigh, OK.

Start Test 8 - A World
v Simple renderer
  v draw bodies
  v viewport surrounds everything automatically
    v do it body-by-body for now, until cells exist

Event Queue, and Time.
The world has a big queue of events, in time order. Future events are predictions that may be invalidated by earlier
events.
The trick here is to separate the runtime order in which events are added, and the game-time order in which they
are dequeued and processed.

v init events: body exiting cells

  v Game uses resolver, or whatever, to handle hit events.

Timeouts:
v timeout event: spirit scheduled to do something, like accelerate, sense, react to something that happened earlier, etc.
  Scheduling things to happen at floating-point times is the key to making reflex-time important for NPCs

Cell collider
v sparse grid of cells
v cell
  v array mapping hitgroup index to list of pathIds
v map from bodyId to body
v map from pathId to body. (If a body has a different pathId, then the index one is invalid)

  v enter-cells test, event (zero or one) - bounding rect's leading point crosses a cell x or y line

v enter-cell event causes
  x overlap tests (maybe not?)
  v time-to-hit tests
  v enter-cells test for next edge or axis
v exit-cell test removes bodyId from departed cells

v Test 9: Bodies animated by a spirit, using timeouts

Rayscan
API?
world.rayscan(hitGroup, startPos, endOffset, shape, rad, rectRad)
returns a WorldEvent? No. Separate RayScanResult thingy, allocated by client.
v world.rayscan(request, result);
v RayscanRequest has that stuff: hitGroup, startPos, endOffset, shape, and one of rad, or rectRad.
v RayscanResult: is like a WorldEvent a little


Controls
The idea is abstract away the following from the game logic:
1) Device type: keyboard, mouse, trackpad, touchscreen, or combo.
2) Sample rates and game framerates. Use milliseconds for everything.
The actual JS events happen between frames.
They could be buffered by the event-handler code, and then consumed on-demand during the event loop.
But they should also ping a callback, because it's possible to do really on-demand between-frame
physics updates, by advancing the simulation up to the time of the event, and then applying the effect.
When the animation-frame hits, it advances the sim the rest of the way, then draws, I guess. Hm.
I'm assuming that I have 16ms to simulate and draw, after each 60Hz RAF event, before we start skipping frames.

Example: A player taps the "x" key: down/up between frames. It should still count, so final state isn't enough.
But if a player is holding a button down, that needs to persist too.
So the controller is stateful, consumes events, and produces state and more events.

Basic use cases:
1) Button: queue every down and up, with timestamp, plus current state and start timestamp (last event basically).
2) Stick: current vector, w magnitude from 0 to 1. Plus down/up state w timestamp, queue, last.
  * kbd params: the keys for up/dn/rt/lt
  * touch params: drag radius, boundary function
  * pointer-lock params: can it be done? Does it still give down/up?
API considerations
Write games for multiple input types, joining multiple input classes into one abstract input.

Example 1: twinstick shooter supporting keyboard, touch, and mouselock/keyboard combo.
* Define movement keys and touch-zone, and combine them into one Stick for movement.
* Define firing keys, touch-zone, and mouselock, and combine then onto one Stick for firing.
So all sticks types, like KeyStick, TouchStick, and MouseLockStick, will have different configuration options
(keys, touch-zones, radius, etc) but they'll all produce the same output. Then a PolyStick can accept many
sticks as imput, combine them, and produce the same kind of stick output. One could also create a BackwardsStick,
a SpinningStick, a RandomStick, DelayStick, other handicaps, both as filters and as additions.
How are sticks combined? Add inputs, and clip (not scale) to unit circle.

Example 2: Vorp's grab and drop buttons.
* Keyboard: Z and X
* Touch: define two overlapping rects or circles or whatevs - functions of touch points I guess?
* Mouselock: map left and right mouse buttons. (new idea there!)
How are buttons combined? On every child up/down, the parent is down if any child is down.

Canvas layers
Examples:
* Background with map, drawn once, redrawn only in dirtyrect chunks when map changes.
  May be written to with marks and stains and stuff as the action wears on.
  What's special is that the canvas holds the entire background, and the canvas element itself moves.
  Is that even wise? Maybe I should use a tile system, where the tiles are canvases that get rendered and recycled
  as needed. But lets just get a single giant tile in there for now.
* Foreground with all the action, fully redrawn every turn. The canvas itself does not move.
* Debug overlay layer that can be turned on and off. Also probably shouldn't move, but maaaybe.
Tasks:
v Make it work

FRACAS II
Remember my first JS game ever, http://plexode.com/fracas ?
Time for that remake, featuring the same ascii text level format, roughly:
.: floor
#: wall
=: (new!) destructible wall
g: gnome
G: gnome generator
$: gold
+: health
@: player start
>: exit

Gnomes will wander, avoiding obstacles, until they see the player. Then they attack!
Generators do a rayscan before generating, to avoid overlapping.
Treasure and health won't occupy the whole floorspace. Monsters can go over them...
But to make up for it I'll add destructable walls the player can blast through.

WebGL text
I've got a design for a 3D typeface, which I call "sticks". Everything is made of sticks,
which are stretched cubes.
A character can be expressed as a list of line segments, where each is x0, y0, x1, y1.
To make a 3D stick, start with a unit cube, stretch it to the right length, rotate it,
and translate it into position.

v Fix multipointer up/down timing to catch between-frame up/down events.
  * Repro is to tap trackpad. The down/up can happen between frames,
    so the polling clients miss it. But I like polling clients, and
    hate listener callbacks.
  * So keep a circular buffer of log of events, timestamped. ID, type (down/move/up/cancel?), x, y.
  * Continue to maintain a double-buffer of old state and new state.
  * Write clearEventLog() method to use at the end of each frame that flips the
    old/new state buffers, and advances the circular buffer pointer so it's empty.
  * If anyone needs more than one frame, they can buffer it themselves I
    think. So 10 fingers x 10 events/frame ought should be enough.
