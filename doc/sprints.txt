Some nodes...
line node {
  series:[{t, pa, pb}, {t, pa, pb}...] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity or series
}
translate node {
  series:[{t, pos}+] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t

Editor Improvements
v Only redraw a dirty rect, or a list of affected quadrants.
v Mouse support
v Hall Pills: Affect the space between to events connected by dragging - update HallPainter,
and capture drags in event handling code.
  v dist from segment to point
  v drag tracking
  v proper hall pill painter

v Simple AABB rect object, like vec2d.

#### MILESTONE: Nice editable mazes, for mouse and touch
#### COMPLETE
What I learned:
* Quadtrees are cute but kind of a pain in the A too because they're not a simple grid.
* The system of void/wall/floor drawing is good. Keep it.
* Multi-gesture+mouse drawing-based map editing is really great, and I want to keep that.
* Turns out the Vorp code isn't as easy to reuse and adapt as I'd hoped.

Now it's time to rewrite the physics & gameplay engine, to be easier to understand and use.

Body
* Used by the internal collider to enqueue future events.
* Used by the internal default collision response code.
* Used by Sprites, through a careful API which handles pathId invalidation.
v Identity
  v id
  v spiritId or 0
v Path
  v pathId - changes whenever a trajectory field changes. 0 means it's invalid.
  v pathStartTime - just for calculating position as func of time
  v pathStartPos
  v vel
  v pathEndTime - for not looking ahead too far, if acceleration is scheduled.
v Shape (affects path)
  v shapeType (circle or rect)
  v rad (for circles)
  v radX (for rects)
  v radY (for rects)
v hitGroup (changing invalidates path. Probably changes infrequently.)
v mass
v elasticity
v getPosAtTime(t, out)
v getBoundingRect(t, out)
v set pos & vel
v alloc & free
I'm trying to be uncompromising: Don't create an object field pointing to a parent. Pass the parent in to methods.

Spirit baseclass
A spirit subclass can have lots of custom logic, scheduling, sensing, body-manipulation, etc.
v id
v world event handlers: start, timeout, hit
x bodyIds? Or just methods that take lists of bodies, and single bodies?

World (but not all its collider aspects)
v spirits {id: spirit}
v bodies {id: body}
v pathIdToBody {id: body}
v world's spirit-facing API:
  v addBody
  v removeBody
  v getBody
  x setTimeout
  x cancelTimeout
  (later: rayscans)
v getBodyByPathId purges obsolete pathId keys

How will path invalidations get buffered up for when the World needs to move time forward?
Easy way is to make each Body hold World, like a parent pointer. I tried to avoid it but maybe I can't.
It's cleaner to include the PathInvalidator in each Body, and the World, like Vorp does. Sigh, OK.

Start Test 8 - A World
- Simple renderer
  v draw bodies
  - viewport surrounds everything automatically
    - do it body-by-body for now, until cells exist

Event Queue, and Time.
The world has a big queue of events, in time order. Future events are predictions that may be invalidated by earlier
events.
The trick here is to separate the runtime order in which events are added, and the game-time order in which they
are dequeued and processed.
Events:
- body entering/leaving cell (no cells yet for provide command format)
- two bodies colliding
  - creation/teleport overlap
  - time-to-hit border contact.
- chain constraint violated (if I ever do chains)
- timeout: spirit scheduled to do something, like accelerate, sense, react to something that happened earlier, etc.
  Scheduling things to happen at floating-point times is the key to making reflex-time important for NPCs

overlap tests
- rect/rect
- circ/circ
- rect/circ
- draw overlaps and non-overlaps

time-to-collision tests
- rect/rect
- circ/circ
- rect/circ

Cell collider
- sparse grid of cells
- cell
  - array mapping hitgroup index to list of pathIds
- map from bodyId to body
- map from pathId to body. (If a body has a different pathId, then the index one is invalid)
- body creation causes...
  - overlap tests & immediate hit events w bodies in cells
  - time-to-hit tests, events (multiple)
  - enter-cells test, event (zero or one) - bounding rect's leading point crosses a cell x or y line
  - exit-cells test, event (zero or one) - bounding rect's trailing point crosses a cell x or y line
- enter-cell event causes
  - overlap tests (maybe not?)
  - time-to-hit tests
  - enter-cells test for next edge or axis
- exit-cell test removes bodyId from departed cells
