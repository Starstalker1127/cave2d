game4 multiplayer rendering
v zoom
v selective tile draw
v selective spirit draw
v shader for circle mask

Refactoring
v pull renderer up out of test44-45 and game4 and replace the main renderer
- standardize metrics, graphing code chunks
  * it's all copies of itself today, and lots of it
- pull game4's splashes into a new file, like I did for "sounds"


- join/drop effects - use existing spawn and death for now

Game4 Basic Mechanics
- Entrance
- Critters
