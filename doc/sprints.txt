v take over old game4

reduce setScreenListening redundancy
v shrink testscreen's setScreenListening()
v ditto for playscreen
v repeat for all the play/test code that could use it throughout cave2d

v testScreen inherits from playScreen, to de-dupe a lot of code.

game4 multiplayer controls
v controlName, controlState files
v create the 7 slots
  v study test45
  v page calls configurePlayerSlots() near initializing the world
  v screen.configurePlayerSlots()
    v models and stamps
      v models.glyphs
  v screen.handleInput()
    v slots
      v join
        v playerJoin(slot)
          v playerSpawn(slot)
      v drop
        v playerDrop()
    v PlayerSpirit.handleInput
      v unpack and use controls
      v make tractor beams work like test45
v Render the hud
v Add the mid-screen pause widget

game4 multiplayer rendering
- zoom
- selective tile draw
- selective spirit draw
- shader for circle mask

- ant logic - don't aim for average player position any more (but I'll probably remove the ants)

- join/drop effects - use existing spawn and death for now

standardize metrics, graphing
* it's all copies of itself today, and lots of it

pull game4's splashes into a new file?
