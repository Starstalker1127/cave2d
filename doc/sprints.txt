Some nodes...
line node {
  series:[{t, pa, pb}, {t, pa, pb}...] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity or series
}
translate node {
  series:[{t, pos}+] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity
}
rotate node {
  series:[{t, rads}+] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity
}
scale node {
  series:[{t, scale}+] sorted by t.
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity
}
// zomg the power of the series! Slomo, fastmo, reverse, scratch...!
delay node {
  series:[{t, delay}+] sorted by t
  startTime: t, or default to series[0].t
  endTime: t or infinity
}

Basic Nodes
v line
  v one whirly hexagon
v translate
  v two moving whirly hexagons
    v tree traversal is automatic
    v basenode works as collection of subnodes
    v subgraph reuse works
- rotate
  - three rotating whirly hexagons
- scale
  - four growing and shrinking whirly hexagons
- delay
  - five hexagons, at 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x speed
