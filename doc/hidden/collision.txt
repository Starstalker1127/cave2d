Collisions can have many results.
Basic:
- wall is damaged
- object bounces
- object is destroyed
- new things are created
- splashes
- sounds
- object is altered
  - damaged
  - healed
  - signalled
  - energized
  - slimed
  - iced
  - stunned
  - blinded
- arbitrary code!
Depends on...
- contact point
- mass
- relative velocity, spin
- angle of strike
- elasticity, grip
- health, damage
- team membership? Or try not to worry about that?
- damage type and immunities?
  - kinetic
  - fire

* fundamental rules:
  1) Exactly two objects collide.
  2) Collision effects are simultaneous. Execution order must not matter.
 - small number of re-usable collision-resolution spirit labels?
   - wall (special because digging and stuff)
   - neutral
   - neutral fire - in the best world all fire would be neutral. Worth trying?
   - player - hurt by enemy+neutral fire
   - player fire
   - enemy - hurt by player+neutral fire. Includes slow enemy missiles
   - enemy fire
 - reduce to just "being" and "fire", and team?
 - centralized rules for resolving collisions among these.

* common spirit system for all combat so I don't have an n^2 problem
- spirit API
  - defender
    - takesDamage() boolean
    - applyDamage(float)
      - die()
  - attacker
    - getCollisionDamage(collision) float
- health
- damage
- death
